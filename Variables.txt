A variable is an creating an object with a spesific purpose such as:
int = an integer or whole number
float = a number that could be a fraction or decimal
string = a word or multiple words
char = a single character (like 'a', 'b', or 'c')
bool = a boolean or true/false statement.

Variables are like home addresses for information. For example: 
	int age = 0;
The information can be altered by a user (if it is a public variable) by inputing different information or by
a formula within the code:
	int age = 0;
	age++;
