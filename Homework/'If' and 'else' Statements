If and else statements are used to determine different outcomes. For example if I were to determine what color goes to which person based on age, I would ask for the age of two people.

int person1 = 18, person2 = 22;
if (person1 > person2)
{
  print ("Your color is White.");
}
else if(person < person2)
{
  print ("Your color is Green.");
}
else
{
  print ("Your color is Pink.")
}
